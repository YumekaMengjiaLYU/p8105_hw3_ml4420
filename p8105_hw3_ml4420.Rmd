```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

library(p8105.datasets)
data("instacart")
```

# Problem 1



```{r exploratory data analysis}
# check the number of rows and columns
dim(instacart)

# examine the dataßßß
glimpse(instacart)


```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
